I have tried and failed in making the functionalities come to fruition. If I had more time, maybe I would have figured it out. 
I faced many stupid minor problems, that took hours to fix and some I couldnt at all.

I used a django rest.framework api in hand with mysql for a backend local database, I took a snapshot of the databases in case you
can recreate it,since our localhost will be different.

activate virtual environment: .venv/scripts/activate
runserver: python manage.py runserver

I faced a CORS issue which I dealt with via a CORS chrome extension, of which I have included as well.

my kit.fantawesome.js file kept getting blocked and turning off, thus the missing icons.
